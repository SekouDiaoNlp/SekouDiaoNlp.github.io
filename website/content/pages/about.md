I am a Natural Language Processing and AI specialist.



I studied Computer Science and Natural Language Processing at the University of Bordeaux,
where I focused my academic interests in the Theoretical Linguistics field of Syntax called [Lexical Functional Grammar](https://scholar.google.fr/scholar?q=lexical+functional+grammar&hl=fr&as_sdt=0&as_vis=1&oi=scholart).

I presented this Lexical Functional Grammar [paper](http://nlp.ipipan.waw.pl/HeadLex16/clement_sekou.pdf) at the HeadLex16
conference at thePolish Academy of Sciences, Warsaw, Poland.

    :::bibtex
    @inproceedings{clement:hal-02489993,
      TITLE = {{For a unified treatment of particle verbs (Headlex16)}},
      AUTHOR = {Cl{\'e}ment, Lionel and Diao, Sekou},
      URL = {https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-02489993},
      BOOKTITLE = {{Joint 2016 Conference on Head-driven Phrase Structure Grammar and Lexical Functional Grammar (Headlex16)}},
      ADDRESS = {Varsovie, Poland},
      YEAR = {2016},
      MONTH = Jul,
      PDF = {https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-02489993/file/clement-sekou-3.pdf},
      HAL_ID = {hal-02489993},
      HAL_VERSION = {v1},
    }

However, I left Academia and am now working in the private sector.

I am the author of multiple Open Source Python projects, notably mlconjug3,
an AI system that knows how to conjugate verbs even made up ones or verbs coming from slang language in French, English,
Spanish, Italian, Portuguese and Romanian.



You can find this particular project on [GitHub](https://github.com/SekouDiaoNlp/mlconjug3), [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/mlconjug3/) and [Anaconda](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/mlconjug3) .



I am particularly interested in the intersection of Natural Language Processing and AI.



I have a great deal of experience in developing chatbots and vocal assistants.



I am also a great lover of Blues music ([Albert King](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPcGJahjsHY&t=2524s) and [Luther Allison](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3Qhg4PU8BQ) are the greatest Blues guitar heroes
in my not so humble opinion ðŸ˜Ž). 



If you click on their names you will get redirected to their greatest live performances.

Apart from the normal NLP and AI stuff, I will occasionally make posts about great Blues artists and use NLP techniques
to give insights about them through the analysis of their lyrics (like which themes they favor the most in their songs,
sentiment analysis of their lyrics, the impact of the place they grew up on their lyrics,
their place in the influence network of blues and rock artists, the grammatical and poetic complexity of their lyrics, etc...).
