I am a Natural Language Processing and AI specialist.

I am the author of multiple Open Source Python projects, notably mlconjug3,

an AI system that knows how to conjugate verbs even made up ones or verbs coming from slang language in French, English,

Spanish, Italian, Portuguese and Romanian.

You can find this particular project on [GitHub](https://github.com/SekouDiaoNlp/mlconjug3), [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/mlconjug3/) and [Anaconda](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/mlconjug3) .

I am particularly interested in the intersection of Natural Language Processing and AI.

I am also a great lover of Blues music.
