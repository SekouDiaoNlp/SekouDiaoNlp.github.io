I am a Natural Language Processing and AI specialist.

I studied Computer Science and Natural Language Processing at the University of Bordeaux,
where I focused my academic interests in the Theoretical Linguistics field of Syntax called [Lexical Functional Grammar](https://scholar.google.fr/scholar?q=lexical+functional+grammar&hl=fr&as_sdt=0&as_vis=1&oi=scholart).

I am the author of multiple Open Source Python projects, notably mlconjug3,

an AI system that knows how to conjugate verbs even made up ones or verbs coming from slang language in French, English,

Spanish, Italian, Portuguese and Romanian.

You can find this particular project on [GitHub](https://github.com/SekouDiaoNlp/mlconjug3), [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/mlconjug3/) and [Anaconda](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/mlconjug3) .

I am particularly interested in the intersection of Natural Language Processing and AI.

I have a great deal of experience in developing chatbots and vocal assistants.

I am also a great lover of Blues music ([Albert King](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPcGJahjsHY&t=2524s) and [Luther Allison](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3Qhg4PU8BQ) are the greatest Blues guitar heroes
in my not so humble opinion ðŸ˜Ž. If you click on their names you will get redirected to their greatest live performances.).
